/**
 * VER-06's SAMPLING-RATE guard. A spec runs in one process on one OS and cannot
 * observe a two-OS property, so the load-bearing control for VER-06 is a CI job, not
 * a test. What a spec CAN do is pin the job's shape, and that shape is the whole
 * proof: one leg samples one OS and cannot detect an OS-partitioned cache store at
 * any rate. The Nyquist floor here is two legs.
 *
 * Two clauses, and the SECOND is the one that matters most:
 *
 *   1. `dogfood-verify` declares the two-leg matrix -- otherwise the Windows OS is
 *      never sampled and the cross-OS claim rests on nothing.
 *   2. `dogfood-seed` declares NO matrix. The seed key is
 *      `nx-cache-<GITHUB_RUN_ID>`: ONE key per RUN, not per OS. So a Windows seed leg
 *      makes the Windows verify job restore a WINDOWS-written entry and pass even
 *      with cross-OS restore completely dead. That is the vacuity trap, and this
 *      clause is what makes it structurally unreachable rather than merely
 *      documented. It is also the clause a future contributor is most likely to break
 *      while believing they are improving coverage, which is why its failure message
 *      spells out the reason.
 *
 * Path resolved via import.meta.url (the cleanup-workflow.spec.ts / pinned-deps
 * .spec.ts idiom), NOT __dirname and NOT process.cwd(). Placed at the package-source
 * root rather than in a subdirectory because its subject is a workspace-root workflow
 * file, not a cohesive module (.planning/codebase/TESTING.md spec placement).
 *
 * Only non-comment lines are matched: this file's own prose repeats `windows-11-arm`
 * and `fail-fast` verbatim while explaining the rationale, and `ci.yml`'s OWN comment
 * block above these jobs repeats the same strings, so a naive substring match against
 * the raw file would pass even after the real YAML had drifted. Stripping
 * '#'-prefixed lines first makes every assertion below non-vacuous against the actual
 * config.
 *
 * ASSERTIONS ARE SCOPED PER JOB BLOCK, deliberately. A bare
 * `expect(codeLines).toContain('windows-11-arm')` over all of `ci.yml` is already
 * satisfied by the `integration`, `hash-parity` and `publish` jobs, all of which name
 * that runner today -- so a whole-file match would pass unconditionally, whatever
 * `dogfood-verify` actually says. That is the exact non-vacuity failure this phase
 * keeps guarding against, so the extraction below is narrowed to each job's own block
 * and a positive control asserts the extraction is not empty.
 *
 * This spec depends on `{workspaceRoot}/.github/workflows/ci.yml` being in
 * `nx.json`'s `targetDefaults.test.inputs` (PARITY-08, plan 09-01, `nx.json:69`).
 * Without it, `ci.yml` is not a hashed input and this spec replays a cached PASS
 * computed before its subject existed.
